@room "Dark corridor"

"You enter the long, dark corridor. Your shoes make a squelching sound on the wet floor. The foyer is to the east. There are two doors to the north, what looks like a children's bedroom, and a bathroom. A door at the west end of the corridor seems to lead to the master bedroom."
